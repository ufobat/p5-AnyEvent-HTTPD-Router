# NAME

AnyEvent::HTTPD::Router - Adding Routes to AnyEvent::HTTPD

# DESCRIPTION

AnyEvent::HTTPD::Router is an extension to the `AnyEvent::HTTPD` module, from which it is inheriting.
It adds the `reg_routes()` method to it.

This module aims to add as little as possible overhead to it while still being flexible and extendable.
It requires the same little dependencies that AnyEvent::HTTPD uses.

The dispatching for the routes happens first. If no route could be found, or you do not stop further
dispatching with `stop_request()` the registered callbacks will be executed as well; as if you would use
AnyEvent::HTTPD. In other words, if you plan to use routes in your project you can use this module and
upgrade from callbacks to routes step by step.

Routes support http methods, but custom methods [https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/custom\_methods](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/custom_methods)
can also be used. You don't need to, of course ;-)

# SYNOPSIS

    use AnyEvent::HTTPD::Router;

    my $httpd       = AnyEvent::HTTPD::Router->new( port => 1337 );
    my $all_methods = [qw/GET DELETE HEAD POST PUT PATCH/];

    $httpd->reg_routes(
        GET => '/index.txt' => sub {
            my ( $httpd, $req ) = @_;
            $httpd->stop_request;
            $req->respond([ 200, 'ok', { 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain', }, "test!" ] );
        },
        $all_methods => '/my-method' => sub {
            my ( $httpd, $req ) = @_;
            $httpd->stop_request;
            $req->respond([ 200, 'ok', { 'X-Your-Method' => $req->method }, '' ]);
        },
        GET => '/calendar/:year/:month/:day' => sub {
            my ( $httpd, $req, $param ) = @_;
            my $calendar_entries = get_cal_entries($param->{year}, $param->{month}, $param->{day});

            $httpd->stop_request;
            $reg->respond([ 200, 'ok', { 'Content-Type' => 'application/json'}, to_json($calendar_entries)]);
        },
        GET => '/static-files/*' => sub {
            my ( $httpd, $req, $param ) = @_;
            my $requeted_file = $param->{'*'};
            my ($content, $content_type) = black_magic($requested_file);

            $httpd->stop_request;
            $req->respond([ 200, 'ok', { 'Content-Type' => $content_type }, $content ]);
        }
    );

    $httpd->run();

# METHODS

- `new()`

    Creates a new `AnyEvent::HTTPD::Router` server. The constructor handles the following parameters. All further parameters are passed to `AnyEvent::HTTPD`.

    - `dispatcher`

        You can pass your own implementation of your router dispatcher into this module. This expects the dispatcher to be an instance not a class name.

    - `dispatcher_class`

        You can pass your own implementation of your router dispatcher into this module. This expects the dispatcher to be a class name.

    - `routes`

        You can add the routes at the constructor. This is an ArrayRef.

    - `known_methods`

        Whenever you register a new route this modules checks if the method is either customer method prefixed with ':' or a $known\_method.
        You would need to change this, if you would like to implement WebDAV, for example. This is an ArrayRef.

- `reg_routes( [$method, $path, $callback]* )`

    You can add further routes with this method. Multiple routes can be added at once. To add a route
    you need do add 3 parameters: &lt;method>, &lt;path>, &lt;callback>.

- `*`

    `AnyEvent::HTTPD::Router` subclasses `AnyEvent::HTTPD` so you can use all methods the parent class.

# EVENTS

- no\_route\_found => $request

    When the dispatcher can not find a route that matches on your reuqest, the event `no_route_found` will be emitted.

    In the case that routes and callbacks (`reg_cb()`) for paths as used with `AnyEvent::HTTPD` are mixed, keep in mind that that `no_route_found` will
    happen before the other path callbacks are executed. So for a  `404 not found` handler you could do

        $httpd->reg_cb('' => sub {
            my ( $httpd, $req ) = @_;
            $req->respond( [ 404, 'not found', {}, '' ] );
        });

    If you just use `reg_routes()` and don't mix with `reg_cb()` for paths you could implement the `404 not found` handler like this:

        $httpd->reg_cb('no_route_found' => sub {
            my ( $httpd, $req ) = @_;
            $req->respond( [ 404, 'not found', {}, '' ] );
        });

# WRITING YOUR OWN ROUTE DISPATCHER

If you want to change the implementation of the dispatching you specify the `dispatcher` or `dispatcher_class`.
